                   The story featured in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's Campaign mode serves as a sequel to
                   Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare's Campaign mode, and is set five years later. In the previous
                   game, the player killed Imran Zakhaev, a Russian ultra-nationalist who sought to restore his
                   country back to the glory days of the Soviet Union. Despite this effort however, ultra-nationalists
                   seized control of Russia, and declared Zakhaev a martyr, straining diplomatic relations with
                   the United States. One of Zakhaev's lieutenants, Vladimir Makarov, began a campaign of revenge
                   against the West by committing acts of terrorism throughout Europe.

                   The player primarily controls Sergeant Gary "Roach" Sanderson, a member of an elite counter-terrorist
                   unit named Task Force 141. In addition to Roach, the player will also assume control of Private First
                   Class Joseph Allen and Private James Ramirez of the United States Army Rangers. Severalnon-playable
                   characters feature prominently in the story. John "Soap" MacTavish. serves as a senior
                   member of Task Force 141, acting as Roach's superior officer. Another member of the unit is
                   Lieutenant Simon "Ghost" Riley, who conceals his face with a skull print balaclava. Sergeant
                   Foley, along with his subordinate, Corporal Dunn, is initially Joseph Allen's squad leader, and
                   becomes James Ramirez's squad leader later in the story. Lieutenant General Shepherd is the commander
                   of the United States Army Rangers and Task Force 141.
